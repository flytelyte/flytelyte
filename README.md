👋 Hi, I'm Yuki Oshiro
Computer Science Student @ ELTE | Quantum Enthusiast | ML | Software Auditor

I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE). My interest sits at the intersection of semantic analysis, software auditing, and quantum computing. Currently, I am expanding my technical horizons by participating in Master's-level research project at the ELTE Modeling Lab.


📊 What I'm Working On
    
    🔭 Modeling Lab Research: Deep-diving into framework architecture as part of an advanced research group.
    
    🛡️ Cybersecurity: Refining my BB84 protocol implementation and exploring new cryptographic standards.
